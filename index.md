## Meet the Fellows

Founded in 1968, the Watson is a rare window of time after college and pre-career for promising undergraduates to engage their deepest interests on a world scale. Chosen from select American colleges, fellows conceive original projects, execute them independently outside of the United States for one year and embrace the ensuing journey. They decide where to go, who to meet and when to change course. The program produces a year of personal insight, perspective and confidence that contributes deeply to fellows' becoming more humane and effective leaders in the world community.

These fellows come from 2 countries and 8 states. They have traveled to 66 countries exploring topics ranging from fermentation to environmentalism; from black womenâ€™s liberation through art to photographing soccer; from urban rail travel to computer science education. These are their journeys.
