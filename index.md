## Meet the Fellows

Founded in 1968, the Watson is a rare window of time after college and pre-career for promising undergraduates to engage their deepest interests on a world scale. Chosen from select American colleges, fellows conceive original projects, execute them independently outside of the United States for one year and embrace the ensuing journey. They decide where to go, who to meet and when to change course. The program produces a year of personal insight, perspective and confidence that contributes deeply to fellowsâ€™ becoming more humane and effective leaders in the world community.

These fellows come from 3 countries and 25 states. They have traveled to 92 countries exploring topics ranging from wildlife conservation to narrative medicine; from marginalized language preservation to perceptions of disability; from textile histories to mental health in sports. These are their journeys.
