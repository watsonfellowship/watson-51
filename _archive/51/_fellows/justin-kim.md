As a Korean American immigrant, I grew up conflicted about my own identity-where I came from, where I was going, and where I belonged. Part ethnography, part oral history, part critical fabulation, I will spend my Watson year building a polyphonic portraiture of the Korean diasporic community through film. I will speak with and document those in the Korean diaspora with living memories of their displacement or emigration. My hope is to elevate Korean diasporic consciousness and raise questions about where we are heading.
