My project explored the relationship between humans and the ocean. Through interacting with fisherman, sailing, and working on boats, I gained insight into the ways coastal communities depend on the sea. This project is aimed at broadening my understanding of oceanography in the hope of becoming a more empathetic and well-informed scientist.
