I’m learning about how humans’ innate connection with nature influences our mental, physical, and spiritual wellbeing. By volunteering with and interviewing people that practice adventure therapy, horticultural therapy, expressive arts, nature art, forest bathing, rites of passage, and many other therapeutic practices, I am gaining new perspectives on what it means to cultivate a healthy life and planet.
