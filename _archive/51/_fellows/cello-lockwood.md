For 5,000 years the horse was a key factor in the advance of human civilization. Today, equine roles have changed, and horses have a limited role in production and services. As a result, horse cultures face increased economic and environmental pressures. I explored the tensions and solutions that have surfaced in response to these contemporary challenges, investigating the feedback loop between horses, the economy, and the environment around them.
