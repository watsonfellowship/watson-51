I explored global musical subcultures as instruments of personal liberation, where collective storytelling contests power, challenges dominant narratives, and achieves social change. As a musician, I joined musical communities across cities, and through direct participation explored how each subculture has emerged from, and in powerful response to, its surroundings.
