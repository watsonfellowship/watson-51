While my Black masculinity has been formed largely within the US, it is tied to a broader international context. I immersed myself in the sociopolitical space of the barbershop - a sacred space in the lives of Black men from a wide breadth of backgrounds. I explored these questions: What are the stories that are shared within this space? What can be learned about the community's values from these conversations? What are the lasting lessons that they impart?
