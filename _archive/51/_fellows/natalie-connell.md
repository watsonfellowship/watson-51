We have yet to understand how to care for the dying in a way that empowers patients and preserves quality of life towards the very end. Fueled by my personal experiences with end-of-life care, I explored how different cultures amidst various religious contexts approach death, dying, and end-of-life care. I learned from experienced doctors, professors, nurses, and non-profit organizations with unique ventures into end-of-life care in order to broaden and deepen my own understanding of what it means to die a good death.
