This year I met and collaborated with queer filmmakers by participating in a film festival, taking on several roles on the production of independent projects, and shadowing executives of production companies. Recognizing queer as an identity, a stance, and/or an action, allowed me to explore the processes that these filmmakers use to define their voices and navigate their experiences.
