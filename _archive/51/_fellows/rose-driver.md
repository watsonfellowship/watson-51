Working alongside cartoonists in Yogyakarta, Singapore, Melbourne, Tokyo, and Berlin, I explored how these artists support one another and their communities. Through my own cartooning, I documented the processes of making comics and sustaining one’s art and one’s self, acknowledging both the material needs of survival and the catharsis and companionship of creating together.
