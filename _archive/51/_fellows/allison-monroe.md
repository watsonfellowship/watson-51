I explored the complexities around insect conservation, bioliteracy, and agency. Collaborating with, and volunteering for, scientists around the world, I learned from local farmers and foresters, taught insect identification and worked with children alongside local translators. Although the scientific world may seem inaccessible, it can be used to empower people to engage and value the significance of insects within our communities.
