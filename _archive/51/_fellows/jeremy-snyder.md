Rivers impact our lives by shaping landscapes and ecosystems everywhere on earth. They flow through the nexus of diverse human cultures, wide-ranging scientific subjects, and ongoing environmental upheavals, and there has never been a better time to understand how the science of river systems impacts us. This year I explored the stories of four major processes through which rivers change our lives and planet: The Sedimentary Cycle, The Carbonate Cycle, How Rivers Live (shaping and being shaped by biology), and How Rivers Die (at the hands of humans who alter and over-use them). Through photography and science communication, I followed these stories along the rivers that tell them, starting with the Andes and Amazon and someday continuing with the rivers of the Himalayas.
