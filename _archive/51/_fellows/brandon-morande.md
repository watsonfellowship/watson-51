My project explores how peer-based initiatives empower people confronting homelessness to share experiences, develop solidarity, and help one another survive the streets. Specifically, I examine how these communities occupy often inaccessible spaces, such as art, literature, and sports, thus changing perceptions of homelessness. To unravel these questions, I interview artists, journalists, musicians, baristas, and activists, documenting their stories on Instagram, @thestreetretold. Ultimately, I hope to amplify their voices and challenge accepted narratives, while further fueling my passions for street outreach.
