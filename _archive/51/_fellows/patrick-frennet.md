Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing how industries operate. With the potential for unprecedented levels of automation in the workplace, the associated human cost in terms of joblessness will likely be huge. I was in conversation with stakeholders - government officials, researchers, and workers across the globe -- understanding their thoughts, feelings, and predictions for an AI future. I hope to highlight the human consequences of disruptive technologies, and how they will play a role in the social, economic, and political future of the 21st century.
