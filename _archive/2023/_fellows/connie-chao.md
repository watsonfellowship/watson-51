I shadowed and interviewed community health workers (CHWs) to understand how their relationships, knowledge, roles, and experiences help connect community members and health systems. I observed enablers and barriers to CHWsâ€™ work and ways they address barriers to strengthen health systems and provide accessible, innovative, and just care in communities.
