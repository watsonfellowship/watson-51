I have collaborated with various organizations dedicated to promoting literacy and fostering parent-child reading experiences. These include NGOs, children's bookstores, libraries, local schools, and book festivals. Through my involvement, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the inspiring stories of individuals committed to this important work.
