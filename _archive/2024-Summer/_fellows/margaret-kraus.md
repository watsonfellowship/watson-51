Thriving in our cities, urban animals show that our lives are deeply interdependent. During my Watson year, I explored human connections with nonhuman animals in major cities around the world, uncovering interspecies relationships within these concrete ecosystems that challenged the separation between humanity and nature. My life became the fabric of my project, intertwined with those of the people and creatures I encountered.
