By engaging with activists, advocacy groups, archives, and artistic practices, I asked: what is queer authenticity? An imperative? A performance? A communal practice? An ideal circumscribed by violence? How is the pursuit of authenticity embedded in struggles for representation, resistance, and justice in queer lives across place and time?
