I traveled across three continents seeking visual arts in Subsaharan Africa through context, content, form and style; spotlighting formal elements of art as a Visual Love Language for Africanity, and emphasizing the creativity of re-presenting through art, especially to encourage critical thinking and disassemble binary thinking about race.
