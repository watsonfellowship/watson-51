Approximately 88% of countries use traditional medicine to prevent and treat illnesses, yet its contribution to the global health field is often overlooked. What stories do different cultures tell about diseases? How do people endeavor to preserve remedies and recipes? What elements are lost when traditional medicine is studied by global health institutions? I explored these questions in the pursuit of a more just, holistic, and effective global healthcare system.
