## Meet the Fellows

Founded in 1968, the Watson is a rare window of time after college and pre-career for promising undergraduates to engage their deepest interests on a world scale. Chosen from select American colleges, fellows conceive original projects, engage them independently outside of the United States for one year and embrace the ensuing journey. They decide where to go, who to meet and when to change course. The program produces a year of personal insight, perspective and confidence that contributes deeply to fellowsâ€™ becoming more humane and effective leaders in the world community.

The fellows come from 18 states and 5 countries. They traveled to 78 countries exploring topics ranging from community-centered AI to agroforestry; from end-of-life care to interfaith advocacy; from seabird communities to soundscapes. These are their journeys.
