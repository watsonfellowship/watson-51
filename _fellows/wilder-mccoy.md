I explored the intersection of socially responsible investment and nuanced ways to value water. Instead of viewing water as a static economic resource, I studied how water has concrete social, cultural, and religious dimensions that should be accounted for in water resource governance. The project was a unique opportunity to work with communities, NGO's, and investors who all have a role in valuing the world's most important resource: Water.
