Extremophiles are organisms that survive the nearly un-survivableâ€”volcanic magma, the depths of polar ice, the vastness of outer space. During my year, I engaged with indigenous communities, scientists, and researchers to explore how extremophiles can illuminate our understanding of life's tenacity and serve as a blueprint for resilience in our changing world.
