By engaging with healers and patients, I explored myriad forms of traditional medicine, the impact of colonization/modernization, and its integration with allopathic medicine. I learned how these interactions shape individuals’ and communities’ perspectives of and trust in traditions, culture, and identity, as I also strove to understand my roots.
