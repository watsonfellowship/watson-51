Mushrooms and fungi are foundational to life on earth and leveraging their importance can yield solutions to some of the worldâ€™s most pressing issues. To explore this, I spent time with mycologists, farmers, chefs, and designers envisioning fungi-forward initiatives for environmental health and regenerative food systems. I discovered a collaborative vision for building climate resilience with fungi through education, conservation, innovation, and community.
