The disability community makes up 17% of the global population, the world’s largest minority. Yet members of the disabled community are often invisible, unrepresented in media and forgotten in design and policy. For my Watson Project, I will travel to Sweden, New Zealand, Ireland, and Italy to see how culture influences the definition and perception of disability. I will place myself in spaces that center disability in order to interact with the disabled community, emphasizing their voices and experiences during my year. I am particularly interested in the day-to-day barriers to access that disabled individuals face, and how they may fluctuate across the globe. By the end of my Watson Year, I will develop close connections to the global disabled community, establish relationships with disability advocacy organizations, and witness how culture plays into the fluidity of disability’s definition and perception.
