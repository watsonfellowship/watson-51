I traveled to see how culture influences the definition and perception of disability. I placed myself in spaces that centered disability in order to interact with the disabled community, emphasizing their voices and experiences during my year. I was particularly interested in the day-to-day barriers to access that disabled individuals face, and how they fluctuated across the globe. l developed close connections to the global disabled community, established relationships with disability advocacy organizations, and witnessed how culture plays into the fluidity of disabilityâ€™s definition and perception.
