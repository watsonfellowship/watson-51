I focused on garnering a perspective on family refugee healthcare through the narratives of displaced communities, non-for-profit organizations, government branches, medical institutions, and local communities. I looked at the political and economic climates of each location to get insight on the impact they had on healthcare accessibility for displaced individuals.
