Spaces that promote healthy masculinity and encourage vulnerable conversation are key to reducing men’s harm towards themselves and others. Through the year, I spoke with and worked alongside stakeholders in male-focused prevention, including those focused on boys’ mental health, equal parenting, behavior change for people using violence, and survivor-centered care.
