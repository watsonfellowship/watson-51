Through meetings and residencies with the worldâ€™s experts on amphibian health, I explored the intricacies of an underrepresented globally distributed fungal pandemic. Field surveillance and laboratory internships introduced me to 100+ new species of amphibians, their habitats and research methods, and eleven new countries and the cultures and people therein.
