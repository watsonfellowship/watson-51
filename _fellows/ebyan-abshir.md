What purpose does memory serve in a world marked by conflict, atrocity, and genocide? In what ways do post-conflict societies preserve those memories? How universal is their application in pursuit of ‘never again’? In a year of travel, I explored how nations confront, reconcile with, and transition from past atrocities. Moreover, I learned of the power of memory in restoring, preventing, and at times, perpetuating the wounds of the past.
