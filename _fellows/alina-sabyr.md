Astronomy and the sky have been essential for many cultures since the ancient past. This year I explored ways in which people connect with astronomy to understand what impact and benefit astronomy has on our modern society. Through personal stories, activities at planetariums and observatories, astronomy clubs, local star lore and more, I investigated astronomy’s place in our society. Why do we engage with astronomy and how does it benefit both individuals and communities?
