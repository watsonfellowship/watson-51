I explored strength-based, collective approaches to healing intergenerational trauma that re-centered culture as a central feature of wellbeing, re-affirming that healing and well-being are political, not just clinical. I examined systemic harm and engaged in community action that encouraged people to analyze these issues to avoid self-blame.
