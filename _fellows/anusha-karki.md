In source countries, I talked to people aspiring to work abroad as a domestic helper, returned foreign domestic workers, recruitment agencies and community leaders. Similarly, in destination countries, I engaged in conversations, attended community rallies, conferences, and union meetings to understand how each country’s labor laws protect foreign domestic workers or lack thereof.
