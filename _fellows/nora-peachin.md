I studied the right to food and how different players (charities, mutual aid organizations, community kitchens, politicians, etc.) advance or hinder it. I wanted to understand the causes and perceptions of inequality in wealthy countries, and see which attempts at eliminating inequality and achieving the universal right to food are most effective.
