I studied the right to food and how different players — community kitchens, charities, mutual aid organizations, activists, political leaders, restaurants — advance or hinder it. My primary focus was on communal dining spaces. I wanted to understand what strategies these spaces found most effective for reducing food insecurity, and socioeconomic inequality more broadly.
