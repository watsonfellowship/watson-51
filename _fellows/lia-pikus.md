I explored the essentiality of creative practice in world-building, focusing on arts’ ability to foster community, share ideas and connect people to one another. Specifically, I explored the role of the arts in the collective re-imagination of justice around the world. Integrating myself into local musical communities as a cellist, I came to understand through direct participation, as well as through interviews and community-partnerships, the unique ability of the arts to create portals into new worlds.
