By engaging with international literary production teams, newspaper publications, libraries, writersâ€™ workshops, and artists, I sought to understand how literary programs can be designed responsively to the needs of those they serve. To further examine community practices, I looked towards international research networks, heritage trusts, and municipal recreation infrastructure.
