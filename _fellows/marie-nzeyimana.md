While caregiving can bring great satisfaction, it can also cause great harm. Caregiving can reduce an individual's ability to work, engage in relationships, and maintain one's own physical and mental health. During my Watson year I explored the role of caregiving women, learned what factors led them to the role, and how they built community and performed self-care.
