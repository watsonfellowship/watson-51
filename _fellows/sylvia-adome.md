I investigated how African artists operated both abroad and in their home countries, addressing distinct challenges. I explored community-building, fundraising strategies, and youth creative opportunities. I examined how their origins influenced artists' performances, aiming to challenge simplistic categorizations, celebrate cultural diversity and ultimately, promote artistic liberation and resilience globally.
