I explored how adolescents are impacted by sexuality education. Specifically, how different countries' policies, best practices, societal norms, and politics affect the education young people receive. Were young people who received comprehensive sexuality education able to vocalize their wants, needs, and desires? And, how can we better empower adolescents?
