I explored different types of trauma in each country, looking for answers to the questions: “How do one heal from trauma true storytelling?” “How do people cope with different types of trauma?” and “What are the forms by which these traumatic experiences can be best shared to help individuals find healing and hope?” I explored the topic of trauma from ‘psychological’, ‘neurological’, and ‘personal experience’ perspectives.
