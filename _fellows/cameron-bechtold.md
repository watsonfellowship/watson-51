My project explored the connections between community, policy, and science in countries that were working to solve water-related crises. Each community I visited had a history closely linked to the water around them, but the link had recently been disrupted by global, national, or local mismanagement of water. I asked what water management practices and solutions were needed for communities to stay cohesive and resilient.
