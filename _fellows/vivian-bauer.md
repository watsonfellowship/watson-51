For my project, I investigated alternative models for artistic spaces that center art as a tool for transformation, education, and liberation in countries where Portuguese is the official language. Through conversations with leaders, educators, artists, and curators, I looked at ways these spaces reach beyond Eurocentric models and give broader access to art and education.
