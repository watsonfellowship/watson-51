I set out to understand how the goals of Laudato Si' are being put into practice at the local level, and how that praxis differs from the theoretical vision of the Vatican offices tasked with implementing them.

I also interviewed Indigenous-Christian climate activists to learn how their motivation to protect nature is rooted in multiple spiritual backgrounds.
