This year, I spent time in France, Ghana, and Cambodia exploring various modes of non-verbal expression. Through taking lessons, conducting interviews, and focusing on community integration, I asked myself and members of the community: What insight is contained in these practices? How can these forms be viewed as mutually transformative?
