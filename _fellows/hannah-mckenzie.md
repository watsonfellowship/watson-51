Queer protagonists utilize nightlife as both a celebration and a practical gatheringâ€”for social resistance and political activism, public health care, and other forms of community-led support. Considering my most personal questions about humanitarianism, I spent the year in nightclubs at the grassroots and in the underground, exploring how people draw on resources within their own communities to seek empowerment in creative ways.
