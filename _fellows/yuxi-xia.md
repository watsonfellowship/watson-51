Why are plant-based establishments thriving in certain places? How are personal identities and social groups formed around plant-based lifestyles? From home kitchens to restaurants, I learned from plant-based eaters while exploring their foodscapes. I explored the motivations for plant-based to understand how we can advance ethical consumption.
