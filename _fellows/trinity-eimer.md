During the COVID-19 emergency, US lockdowns heavily impacted normal rituals of dying and consequently impacted normal grieving processes. On my year I investigated changes in grief cross-culturally post-pandemic in individuals with distinct religious and cultural backgrounds. I based my project in interactions with healthcare workers and bereaved individuals.
