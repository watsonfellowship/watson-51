On my Watson, I am exploring the types of work that children of immigrants do for immigrant parents over their lifetimes and how this work shifts and changes during different life stages. Through interviews with children of immigrants, I consider not just caregiving and its mechanisms of support, but also how we approach the questions that we have about ourselves, our family histories, and our places in the communities and countries in which we live.
