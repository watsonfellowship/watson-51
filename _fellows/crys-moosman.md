For my project, I explored the diversity of global wildlife conservation practices. Through fieldwork and conversations with scientists, citizens, non-profits, governments, rehabilitation centers, and sanctuaries I gained a first-hand knowledge about the work that is being done to protect and understand wildlife, despite the challenges both practitioners and wildlife face.
