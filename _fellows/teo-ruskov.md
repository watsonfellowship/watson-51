I interrogated the way that the category "proper pronunciation" is invented, policed, and subverted in a variety of social contexts. In England I worked with second generation immigrants, in Nepal with contemporary artists, in India with right-wing alpha males, and in Thailand with immigrant monks and their foreigner acolytes.
