My project has led me on a winding exploration of memory, archives, and the unconscious, and the role of the camera and photography in them. Many powerful encounters, short and long, taught me about the power of the photograph in constructing our past, how we choose to remember it, and why. I have gathered ideas and insights about how we shape memory and images, and about the implication this has at a collective level.
