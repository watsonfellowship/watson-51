From Japan’s community-based health messaging to Ireland’s policy-changing reproductive justice narratives, stories empower health when quantitative data cannot provide the whole context. While exploring ways narrative shapes, improves, and sustains community health, I designed narrative-health-based approaches. With my new insights, I will continue advocating for public health through story’s power.
