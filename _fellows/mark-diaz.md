Total Theatre (voice, movement, and acting skill) is the totality of human expression staged to create rapturous performances. Inspired from apprenticeships of traditional dramatic forms (Pastorale, Kabuki, Gambuh, and Opera) and dialogues with intercultural theatre communities, I have devised a new pedagogy for creating fully embodied, community centered Total Theatre in the 21st century.
