I explored community organizing efforts against air pollution in Australia, South Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, and Chile. In each country, I investigated the sociopolitical, cultural, and physical causes, impacts, and solutions to air pollution threats to ultimately understand how citizens across cultures mobilize their communities for lasting change.
