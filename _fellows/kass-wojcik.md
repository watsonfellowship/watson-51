Pollinators are an immensely diverse and important group of animals, but their populations around the world are declining. By working with beekeepers, researchers, conservationists, and agriculturalists, my fellowship year was about exploring the relationship between people, pollinators, and the environment as well as how that relationship is changing in the face of new challenges.
