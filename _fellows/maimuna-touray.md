Abundant Reparations celebrated the healing of Black and Indigenous Caribbeans, impacted by slavery, colonialism, and ecocide. I centered Land stewards and healers, often overlooked in reparations discourse. Connecting with regenerative farmers, herbalists, and animal husbandry practitioners, I witnessed Land's power to heal bodies, communities, and our relationship with the Earth.
