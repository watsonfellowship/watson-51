I spent the past year creating Theatre for Young Audiences (TYA) as a resident artist, guest teacher, and production assistant with different companies around the world. Through puppetry, clown, physical, sensory, and participatory/play-space theatre, I explored how theatre that connects across ages can connect across cultures.
