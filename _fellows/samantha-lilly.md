Mentions of darkness and light are inevitable when discussions concerning suicidality and mental illness arise. However, cliché phrases like: "I was in a dark place,"  allow us new ways of understanding the supposedly irrational and often tragic desire to kill oneself. When we seek to understand these metaphors of darkness and light in an authentic, interdisciplinary, human rights-based fashion, we are given the tools necessary to re-imagine not only why people die by suicide, but why people stay alive. Thus, allowing us the kindling we need to ethically address the systems of oppression that have been designed to keep people in the dark.
