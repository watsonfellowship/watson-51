What do you do in your daily pursuit of food? During my Watson year, I lived among communities struggling with food insecurity and learned how they put food on their tables. From the southern deserts of Madagascar to the streets of India, I witnessed local and international solutions that battle scarcity and malnourishment to improve wellness in communities across the globe.
