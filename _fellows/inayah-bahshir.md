Throughout this project, I explore the ways in which Indigenous Spiritual Practices have been transformed in the modern context. In my research, I have found that indigenous traditions have mainly survived through artistic expression, such as dance, music, poetry, and many forms of storytelling. In most cases, the spiritual traditions have also translated into superstition; yet, I became fascinated with how indigenous traditions can be re-instated within our communal functioning.
