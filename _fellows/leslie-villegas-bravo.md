I explored culturally respectful ways to integrate technology in indigenous and rural communities across eight countries. Through community collaboration, I identified sustainable, inclusive practices that support self-reliance and cultural preservation. My research emphasized adaptability, local narratives, and people-oriented technology that honored diverse traditions and enhanced digital inclusion.
